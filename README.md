# Doc88 - Frontend Challenge

This repository contains the Vue.js implementation of
[Doc88's Frontend Challenge](https://github.com/doc88git/frontend-challenge)
made by me, in this small project I'm using the following tools and methodologies:

  * Indented SASS as the CSS preprocessor
  * [SuitCSS](https://suitcss.github.io/) as the CSS guideline
  * ESLint Standard with a few modifications for linting
  * Vue.js as the main framework for the SPA
  * Vuex for a very basic app state
  * [ZeeValidator](https://github.com/iErik/zee-validator) for basic form validation
  * [VueMouseParallax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-mouse-parallax) for a simple parallax effect
  * Vue CLI 4 for project bootstrapping.
  * Jest for basic unit testing
